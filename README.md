# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and analysis for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Info Tech. For this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of data science. It includes detailed information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as demographics and survival status. This dataset is frequently used for educational purposes and offers a valuable opportunity to apply various data analysis techniques.

## Task Overview

The primary objective of this task was to conduct data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to extract insights from the Titanic dataset. This involved:

- Handling missing values and duplicates.
- Exploring relationships between key variables to identify trends and patterns.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and removed duplicate records.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigated the relationships between variables including gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival rates.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
  - Passengers in higher classes had better survival rates, suggesting a link between socio-economic status and survival chances.
  - Younger individuals generally had lower survival rates, potentially due to prioritization policies during evacuation.

## Conclusion

The data cleaning and exploratory data analysis performed on the Titanic dataset provided valuable insights into factors influencing survival during the Titanic disaster. This analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of historical events and demonstrates the practical application of data science techniques to derive meaningful insights from data.
